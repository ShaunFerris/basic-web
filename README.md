# basic-web
A collection of basic webpages made to practice HTML and CSS. These are meant to be simple template pieces using only vanilla HTML and CSS, without the need for including any frameworks or managing dependancies. The pages are kept here to be repurposed in the future as quick standalone forms, or as the basic layout for pages in larger projects.
